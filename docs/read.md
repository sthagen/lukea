# Reading

The activity of reading conveys a manifold of facets and meanings.
The goals similarly span a spectrum from pastime pleasure, over information harvest, to knowledge gain.

## Activity

Reading from a coffee cup, the lines in the palm of a hand, traces on the ground, even other peoples' minds are out of scope.

We focus on reading written languages (and not even reading between the lines).

### Print

Printed language is read in sync with the medium that provides the characters and symbols.

### Screen

Reading language on a screen provides a physical window into the virtual world of the words.

## Goals

Blindtext is hard to write, isn't it?

## Summary

In this section we visited the reading activities separated by the provisioning medium and shortly prepared a deeper analysis of the goals.
