<img alt="A cloudy vertical landscape." src="../images/title.jpg">

Any picture may be worth a thousand words, but which words is the question.

Some title may appear.

But, a subtitle is far.

There may be some additional frontmatter like copright, library information, change logs, proprietary information, etc.
