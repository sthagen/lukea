# Writing

The activity of writing conveys a manifold of facets and meanings.
The goals similarly span a spectrum from pastime pleasure, over information provisioning, to knowledge spreading.

## Activity

We focus on writing languages.

### Print

Printed language is written in sync with the medium that provides the characters and symbols.

### Screen

Writing language on a screen provides a physical window into the virtual world of the words.

## Goals

Blindtext is hard to read, isn't it?

Imagine some other example text in a fixed font (like a programming language example):

```javascript
const {foo, bar = 42} = {...{foo: {baz: 'quux'}}}
console.log(bar)
```

### Tables

| Method      | Description                |
|:----------- |:-------------------------- |
| `GET`       | Fetch resource             |
| `PUT`       | Update (complete) resource |
| `DELETE`    | Delete resource            |

## Summary

In this section we visited the writing activities separated by the provisioning medium and shortly prepared a deeper analysis of the goals.
