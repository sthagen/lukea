<figure markdown>
  ![A fractal leaf.](images/title.jpg){ width="100%", loading=lazy }
  <figcaption>Beauty may be in petals and in leafs.</figcaption>
</figure>

No further pictures here.

Again:

- Some title may appear.
- And, a subtitle is near.

There may be some additional frontmatter like copright, library information, change logs, proprietary information, etc.

But, for now, we do not care.
