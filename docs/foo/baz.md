I can't play. Thank you. In about thirty years. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Are you gonna order something, kid?

Jane Doe, the actor? Then who's vice president, James Uganda? I suppose Jane Doe is the first lady. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Doc.

Uh, well, I gotta go. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Good morning, Mom.
